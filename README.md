ðŸŒ± About This Repository
This repository contains my practice code as I learn web development. 
Iâ€™m exploring the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to understand how websites are built and how different web technologies work together. 
The code here includes simple layouts, styling experiments, and small scripts as part of my learning journey.
